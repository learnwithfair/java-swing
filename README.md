## JAVA Swing
Swing in Java is a lightweight GUI toolkit that has a wide variety of widgets for building optimized window-based applications. It is a part of the JFC( Java Foundation Classes). It is built on top of the AWT API and entirely written in Java. It is platform-independent unlike AWT and has lightweight components. It is used for creating window-based applications. It includes components like button, scroll bar, text field etc.

This section explains how to compile and run a Swing application from the command line. For information on compiling and running a Swing application using NetBeans IDE, see Running Tutorial Examples in NetBeans IDE. The compilation instructions work for all Swing programs â€” applets, as well as applications. Here are the steps you need to follow:

- Install the latest release of the Java SE platform, if you haven't already done so (JDK).
- Setup Environment variable for JDk
- Install IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse
- Create a program that uses Swing components.
- Compile the program.
- Run the program.
```diff
- Note: File name and class name must be the same.
